# Archive

One line per item that has landed, appended as it lands. The trackers in this folder delete an item
when it lands rather than ticking it off, so this file is the only record that it existed.

- **2026-08-04 — REPO-01** (repo.md, was monorepo-merge "Commit it") — the staged merge is committed,
  as six commits rather than one, ending at `d5fa4027`.
- **2026-08-04 — REPO-02** (repo.md, was editor-todo item 13) — the merge is pushed, `main` and
  `origin/main` both at `d5fa4027`. The twenty `packages/cli/…` source links now resolve, checked by
  fetching `main/packages/cli/src/schemas/agent-frontmatter.schema.json` and getting `200`.
- **2026-08-04 — REPO-17** (repo.md, new, found while extracting) — a `CLAUDE.md` now exists at the
  repository root and is tracked.
- **2026-08-04 — REPO-18** (repo.md, new, found while extracting) — all four dangling references
  repaired: `README.md` now links `todo/repo.md`, both `.syncpackrc.cjs` sites now say REPO-06, and
  `packages/cli/e2e/helpers/test-utils.ts` now cites `harness-decisions.md` § 1.1. The three
  cite-by-item-number references it deliberately left alone survive in `www.md`, `cli.md` and
  `editor.md`.
- **REPO-19** — the CLI's unit suite needed a build no CI step ran; `packages/cli/turbo.json` now declares `test` dependsOn `build`, as `test:e2e` already did. 205 failures to zero.
- **REPO-20** — the deploy job had no Cloudflare credentials. Secrets added to the `production` environment; `deploy` green in 30s.
- **REPO-03** — `git remote` pointed at `claude-collective/cli`. The repository was renamed to `agents-inc/agents-inc` and the remote updated; the redirect warning on every push is gone.
- **REPO-08** — consider renaming the repository. Done: `agents-inc/cli` is now `agents-inc/agents-inc`. The org half is dead — `agentsinc` on GitHub is a dormant organisation from 2013, so a full rename would leave three names where there are now two.
